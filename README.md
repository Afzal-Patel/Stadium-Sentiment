<b>About:</b><br/>

Data Insights is an academic journal for undergraduate data science research. Each article presents a single insight that was somehow gleaned from data. The editorial focus is on a clear exposition that explains why the insight is important. There are no restrictions on the type of data sources used or the methods of analyzing the data, but the best insights typically come from simple analyses.<br/>

<em>Data Insights</em> was largely inspired by the machine learning journal Distill, but there is no official relationship between the two.

<b>Submissions:</b><br/>

Submissions are welcome from any undergraduate student, anywhere in the world.1 To submit an article, issue a pull request into the github repository (found here: https://github.com/mikeizbicki/applieddatascience.pub). This will initiate a back-and-forth process with the editors to polish your submission for publication. When the pull request is finally accepted, your article will be instantly published online.<br/>

To ensure that your submission idea is a good fit for Data Insights, it is recommended to email Mike Izbicki (the instructor for the Data Mining course) before beginning the submission process.
